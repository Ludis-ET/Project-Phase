# ✅ TypeScript Todo List (Function-Based)

This is a simple function-based **Todo List app** written in TypeScript. It runs in the console and demonstrates how to:

- Add todos  
- View all todos  
- Mark a todo as complete  
- Edit a todo title  
- Delete a todo  

## 🧠 Features  

- `createTodo(title)`  
- `fetchTodos()`  
- `markTodoComplete(id)`  
- `editTodo(id, newTitle)`  
- `removeTodo(id)`  

## 🚀 How to Run  

1. **Compile the TypeScript file**  

    ```bash  
    tsc todo.ts  
    ```  

2. **Run the compiled JavaScript**  

    ```bash  
    node dist/todo.js  
    ```  

The program will execute some example function calls and print the results in the console.  

## 📁 Files  

- `todo.ts` – Main TypeScript file with todo logic and sample usage  
- `dist/todo.js` – Compiled JavaScript output after running `tsc`  

Made for practicing TypeScript with object interfaces and array operations.
